# Plagiarism Detection Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I am tasked with 
- building a plagiarism detector that compares a student answer text file with an original Wikipedia source file, and also performs binary classification; 
- computing a few features such as *containment* and *longest common subsequence*, to compare the similarity of the given answer text and the original Wikipedia text file; selecting "good" features by analyzing the correlation between computed features; 
- labeling the given answer file as either plagiarized or not, according to selected features;
- training a model and deploying it using SageMaker;

The Project Notebook I submitted for revision to Udacity's reviewers includes the following files. 
*Notebook 2:* Plagiarism Feature Engineering
*Notebook 3:* Training and Deploying a Model in SageMaker
*training file*: source_sklearn/train.py

Note that "problem_unittests.py" and "helpers.py" are files that used for testing.
